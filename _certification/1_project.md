## ðŸ“˜ **Covered Modules**

1. Foundational Units: where you learn Agents concepts in theory.
2. Hands-on: where youâ€™ll learn to use established AI Agent libraries to train your agents in unique environments. These hands-on sections will be Hugging Face Spaces with a pre-configured environment.
3. Use case assignments: where youâ€™ll apply the concepts youâ€™ve learned to solve a real-world problem that youâ€™ll choose.
4. The Challenge: youâ€™ll get to put your agent to compete against other agents in a challenge. There will also be a leaderboard (not available yet) for you to compare the agentsâ€™ performance.
