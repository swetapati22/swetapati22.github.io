Hello! Iâ€™m **Sweta Pati**, a passionate and dedicated **Masterâ€™s student specializing in Data Science and Natural Language Processing**. Currently pursuing my **Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at George Mason University** with a GPA of **3.93**, I thrive at the intersection of cutting-edge research and impactful real-world applications.

My journey in technology combines **innovative research**, impactful **professional experience**, and a relentless drive to push boundaries.

**Highlights of my work include:**  
- I have hands-on experience in **developing advanced models for Event Extraction** within the domain of Information Extraction by leveraging **instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs)** to advance NLP tasks. Under the guidance of [**Prof. Ziyu Yao**](https://nlp.cs.gmu.edu/author/ziyu-yao/) in **GMUâ€™s Natural Language Processing Lab**, I designed a novel framework to transform natural language instructions into structured Python-based code prompts. This innovation enhanced model interpretability, reduced context ambiguity, and improved generalization across multiple domains within the **Event Extraction tasks**.  
- Before pursuing my Masterâ€™s degree, I gained valuable professional experience as a **Data Scientist** at **Highradius Technologies**, where I worked in **implementing machine learning models and deploying end-to-end machine learning pipelines** for complex regression and imbalance classification use cases. My contributions delivered significant impact for **Fortune 500 companies** such as **Nestle, Kraft Heinz, and Clorox**, driving measurable business outcomes including a **30% reduction in Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)** across clients and a **12% increase in recovery rates in US dollars**. Additionally, my work enhanced **operational efficiency** and automated intricate workflows, enabling greater scalability and client success.

With a strong foundation in **Machine Learning** and expertise in **cloud platforms like AWS**, I excel at transforming unstructured data into actionable insights. My key interests lie in **Machine Learning**, **Generative AI**, **Data Science and Analytics**, and **AI-Driven Automation**, where I have a track-record of exploring and implementing **innovative solutions** that advance technology and deliver meaningful progress.

Beyond academics and professional pursuits, I find joy in **exploring the outdoors**, whether hiking through scenic trails or simply connecting with nature. I also enjoy immersing myself in **captivating books** and keep myself updated through **thought-provoking tech innovations**.

Letâ€™s connect and collaborate to harness the power of **AI and technology** to create a better future! ðŸš€
