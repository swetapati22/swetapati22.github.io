Hello! I’m **Sweta Pati**, a dedicated **Master’s student in Computer Sciene at George Mason University specializing in Machine Learning** with a GPA of **3.93**. My journey combines innovative and cutting-edge research and impactful professional experience.

With key interests in **Machine Learning**, **Data Science and Analytics**, **Generative AI**, and **AI-Driven Automation**, I excel at transforming unstructured data into actionable insights.

**Highlights of my work include:**  
- I have **experience in developing advanced models for Event Extraction (EE)** within the domain of Information Extraction by **leveraging instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs)** under the guidance of  Prof. Ziyu Yao. I designed a novel framework to transform natural language instructions into structured Python-based code prompts and fine-tuned LLaMA 3.1 model, enhancing model interpretability and improved generalization across multiple domains within the EE tasks.  
- Prior to pursuing my Master’s, I gained 3 years of professional experience as a **Data Scientist** at **Highradius**. My work involved **implementing ML models and deploying end-to-end ML pipelines** for complex regression and imbalance classification use cases for Fortune 500 companies such as Nestle, Kraft Heinz, and Clorox enhancing their operational efficiency and automating workflows for greater scalability.

Beyond academics and professional pursuits, I find joy in exploring the outdoors, whether hiking through scenic trails or simply connecting with nature. I also enjoy immersing myself in captivating books and keep myself updated through thought-provoking tech innovations.
