Hello! Iâ€™m **Sweta Pati**, a dedicated **Masterâ€™s student in Computer Sciene at George Mason University specializing in Machine Learning** with a GPA of **3.93**. My journey combines **innovative and cutting-edge research** and impactful **professional experience**.

**Highlights of my work include:**  
- I have experience in **developing advanced models for Event Extraction** within the domain of Information Extraction by leveraging **instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs)**. Under the guidance of  <a href='https://nlp.cs.gmu.edu/author/ziyu-yao/'> <b>Prof. Ziyu Yao</b></a> in **GMUâ€™s Natural Language Processing Lab**, I designed a novel framework to transform natural language instructions into structured Python-based code prompts and fine-tuned LLaMA 3.1 model, enhancing model interpretability, reduced context ambiguity, and improved generalization across multiple domains within the **Event Extraction tasks**.  
- Prior to pursuing my Masterâ€™s, I gained 3 years of professional experience as a **Data Scientist** at **Highradius**. My work involved **implementing ML models and deploying end-to-end ML pipelines** for complex regression and imbalance classification use cases for **Fortune 500 companies** such as **Nestle, Kraft Heinz, and Clorox**, achieving a **30% reduction in Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)** and **12% increase in recovery rates in US dollars** across clients, enhancing their operational efficiency and automating workflows for greater scalability

With key interests in **Machine Learning**, **Data Science and Analytics**, **Generative AI**, and **AI-Driven Automation**, I excel at transforming unstructured data into actionable insights.

Beyond academics and professional pursuits, I find joy in **exploring the outdoors**, whether hiking through scenic trails or simply connecting with nature. I also enjoy immersing myself in **captivating books** and keep myself updated through **thought-provoking tech innovations**.

Letâ€™s connect and collaborate to harness the power of **AI and technology** to create a better future! ðŸš€
