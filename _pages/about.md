Hello! I’m **Sweta Pati**, an **AI/ML Engineer** with **5+ years of experience** designing, deploying, and scaling solutions in **Machine Learning**, **NLP**, **Generative AI**, **RAG**, and **Agentic AI** across domains including FinTech, recruitment, and research.

---

#### Industry & Research Experience:

I specialize in **Machine Learning**, **LLM fine-tuning**, **RAG**, and **Agentic AI systems**, combining applied industry experience with research-backed innovation to build production-ready AI solutions.

- Currently working as an **AI/ML Engineer** at **4A Consulting, LLC**, where I design **modular LLM evaluation systems**, implement **role-aware prompting strategies**, and build **scalable GenAI products** powering an **AI-driven recruitment evaluation platform** for multiple **Fortune 500 clients**.

- As an **NLP Engineer** at **George Mason University**, my work on **instruction-tuning LLMs for event extraction** was accepted at **ACL 2025 (Findings)**. I optimized prompt-based EE models using **machine-generated annotation guidelines** and **Python code-style prompts** to enhance LLM generalization and performance.

- Previously spent 3+ years as an **AI/ML Engineer** at **HighRadius Technologies**, where I led ML initiatives that **improved fraud detection by 12%**, **reduced Days Sales Outstanding by 30%**, and deployed robust, end-to-end pipelines for global clients like **Nestlé**, **Uber**, and **Kraft Heinz**.

#### Technical Interests & Expertise:

- **Large Language Models (LLMs):**  
  Fine-tuning and evaluation of models like **LLaMA**, **GPT**, and other **Transformer-based architectures** using techniques such as **LoRA**, and quantization, instruction tuning, and prompt engineering.

- **Generative AI & Agentic Systems:**  
  Building **RAG pipelines**, developing **Agentic AI frameworks**, and leveraging tools like **LangChain**, **Phidata**, and **agent orchestration** for intelligent task automation.

- **Machine Learning & NLP Applications:**  
  Expertise in **classification**, **regression**, **time series forecasting**, **event extraction**, and deploying solutions for real-world problems in domains such as finance, and recruitment.

- **MLOps & Scalable ML Engineering:**  
  Proficient in designing **CI/CD pipelines**, deploying **FastAPI-based ML services** in **Docker containers**, and managing cloud infrastructure with **AWS**, **GCP**, and **Kubernetes** for reliable and scalable ML workflows.

I excel at transforming unstructured data into actionable insights.

---

#### Education:

I hold a **Master’s degree in Computer Science** with a **specializing in Machine Learning** from George Mason University**.

--- 

#### Actively Seeking:

I’m actively pursuing **full-time opportunities** in **AI/ML**, **NLP**, or **GenAI** roles. My goal is to bring **research-backed engineering** into **real-world AI deployments** that are scalable, interpretable, and impactful.

Feel free to reach out — I’d love to connect!
