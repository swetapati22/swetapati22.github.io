I’m excited to announce that I am starting a **research assistant position** under the guidance of [**Prof. Ziyu Yao**](https://nlp.cs.gmu.edu/author/ziyu-yao/) in **GMU’s Natural Language Processing Lab**! This opportunity will allow me to work on groundbreaking research in **Event Extraction and Prompt Optimization** using instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs).
